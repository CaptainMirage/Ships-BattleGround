## How To Use


### Windows :

1. **Install a C++ Compiler:**
   - Download and install [MinGW](https://github.com/msys2/msys2-installer/releases/download/2023-05-26/msys2-x86_64-20230526.exe) or another C++ compiler like Visual C++.
   - if you cant find any installtion methods for MinGW continue on with [this toturial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw) but dont install VScode, only continue with the MinGW installation

2. **Open Command Prompt:**
   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.

3. **Navigate to the Code Directory:**
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory containing your C++ source code.

4. **Compile the Code:**
   - Use the following command to compile your code:
     ```bash
     g++ your_program.cpp -o your_program.exe
     ```
     Replace `your_program` with the name of your source file.

5. **Run the Executable:**
   - Run the compiled executable:
     ```bash
     your_program.exe
     ```

### macOS and Linux

1. **Open Terminal:**
   - On macOS, find Terminal in Applications > Utilities.
   - On Linux, use the terminal emulator of your choice.

2. **Navigate to the Code Directory:**
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory containing your C++ source code.

3. **Compile the Code:**
   - Use the following command to compile your code:
     ```bash
     g++ your_program.cpp -o your_program
     ```
     Replace `your_program` with the desired name for the executable.

4. **Run the Executable:**
   - Run the compiled executable:
     ```bash
     ./your_program
     ```

### Notes:

- Ensure that you have the C++ compiler installed on your system.
- Make sure your code is in a file with a `.cpp` extension (e.g., `your_program.cpp`).
- The `-o` flag in the compilation step specifies the name of the output executable.
- These instructions assume basic knowledge of navigating the command line.

For any issues, refer to the documentation for your compiler or system.
